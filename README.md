# Notes Collection

Welcome to my collection of notes! This repository is built on the belief that the best way to solidify my understanding of any topic is to explain it clearly to others. If I can't break down a complex concept into digestible pieces that make sense to someone new to the subject, then I probably don't understand it as well as I think I do.

## What You'll Find Here

This is my attempt to take various topics I'm learning about and distill them into clear, accessible explanations. Think of these notes as conversations with a curious friend who's hearing about these topics for the first time.

### Current Focus: Tech Topics

For now, I'm diving into various technical subjects, but I'm organizing everything with the mindset that this could grow into something else. 

## Structure (for now)

```
📁 Topics/
├── 💻 software-developement/
├── 🔒 security/
├── 📊 ai/
```

Each topic folder contains:
- `README.md` - Overview and learning path
- `subjects/` - Core concept explanations
- `examples/` - Code samples and practical demos

## Disclaimer

I am not an expert in any of these areas, and this is just me sharing my personal knowledge. If you find something unclear, confusing, or just plain wrong, please let me know!
